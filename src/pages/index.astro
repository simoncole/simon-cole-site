      I'm a <span class="term-emphasis">computational scientist</span> in the
      SEEDS-Bridge postbaccalaureate program at the
      <span class="term-emphasis">Jennifer Philips-Cremins Laboratory</span> for
      Chromatin and Spatial Neurobiology at Washington University in St. Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm broadly interested in developing and applying analytical and predictive
      computational methods which utilize multi-omics data to elucidate latent
      <span class="term-emphasis">epigenetic</span> dysregulation in
      <span class="term-emphasis">aging</span> and age-related disease.

      I'm currently specifically interested in homeobox domain transcription factors
      <span class="term-emphasis"> DLX1 and LHX2 </span> and their role in the
      miswiring of promoter to enhancer
      <span class="term-emphasis">chromatin loops</span> in
      <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.27.582395v1.full">familial Alzheimer's Disease</a> prior to the accumulation of Aβ and PTau.

      I'm from a small town in North Florida that is home to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakulla_Springs">world's largest freshwater spring</a>
      and, potentially, a <a href="https://wakullavolcano.vashti.net/">volcano</a>.

      I'm known to enjoy reading, writing, running, programming, and thinking. Ideally
      all at once.

      <p>The following are some of the high-level scientific questions that keep me awake at night:</p>
      <ol class="question-list">
        <li>
          How does the genome encode the the wiring specificity of the neural connectome?
        </li>
        <li>
          How do chromatin loops and their associated TFs control cell state? What
          happens when this goes awry?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we make neurons in artificial neural networks work more like real
          neurons in the human brain?
        </li>
        <li>
          Has bio ML taken to heart Richard Sutton's bitter lesson?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can the human body survive the radiation from a trip to Mars?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can we solve aging?
        </li>
      </ol>
